## revenue-diminishing factor for hotels

The online hotel reservation channels have dramatically changed booking possibilities and customersâ€™ behavior. A significant number of hotel reservations are called-off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with.

**Can you predict if the customer is going to honor the reservation or cancel it ?**

```
python3.11 -m venv .venv
```

2. Install required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. In order to see how to run the main program which will train the model. Navigate to **src/uafscs/**

```
